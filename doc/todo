No the support team was not able to provide me with any assistance on this issue. It is how they do it by default. Below is the answer I received to my question... 

When bringing in assets using SNMP our switches are getting asset type of printer. 

"Hi Julie, 

This is actually by design. 
Let me explain : 

Currently when the scan is performed it searches for TYPE INFORMATION for particular OID and expects to get a value. 
OID: 1.3.6.1.2.1.1.7.0 to get a type 

Based on that value , the Type is set according to the below list : 
Type: 0 - DHCP Server 
Type: 1 - Router 
Type: 2 - Switch 

If the type is not either of these numbers then we check 
OID: 1.3.6.1.2.1.43.5.1.1.1.1 if we get ANY value back we call it a Printer, if we do not get any value then we default to DHCP Server 

There is a feature request that re-designs and improves the whole smnp scan procedure. 
From what I heard, this will be sometime in version 17" 

It has not been changed in version 17. Trying to modify the OID's also did not help. The issue is still ongoing for us.
